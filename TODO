TODO

Important
---------
- double-quote all variables
- sanitize input in some areas (mostly where variables are used in sed)
- fix error handling (use error_out function)
- fix exit points (ie: no exit points in functions, only main program)

General
-------
- fix everything
- get everything working
- add support for linode
-- will still work if not using linode, defined in options.conf
-- use the DNS manager API to integrate with domain.sh
- check which user awstats.pl runs as
-- if root, awesome -- all is well
-- if $USER, not good -- going to have to fix permissions, probably
- gradually re-write echo code to use printf instead

Ideas
-----
- perhaps rename project, something along the lines of "bash control" perhaps?
- write more scripts along the lines of wordpress.sh -- "one click installers" for various web apps
- set up an "admin panel" -- phpmyadmin, awstats, etc
-- perhaps use 2 versions
--- per-domain (http://a.site.com)
--- per-site (http://user.site.com/a)
-- control access with .htaccess
-- FORCE SSL

install.sh
----------
- check all code, rewrite
- standardize menus

setup.sh
--------
- check all code, rewrite
- add code to check for existing setup?
- remove unnecessary code
- standardize menus

domain.sh
---------
- double check all code
- test
- add support for Linode API (DNS Manager)

usertools.sh
------------
- set up various permission systems
-- restrict user to their own account (ie, 'ps aux' will only return their own processes)
-- set up screen + irssi *only* accounts
-- add code to temporarily disable web hosting for user *without* destroying user's files (perhaps disable the whole user account)

backup.sh
---------
- check over all code, figure out what it does, etc
- rewrite to meet needs
- standardize menu
